    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the 
    <a href = 'http://railstutorial.org/'>Ruby on Rails Tutorials</a> and
    the <a href = 'http://www.softcover.io/'>Softcover publishing platform</a>.
    This page is part of the sample site for <a href = 'http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial'><em>
    Learn Enough HTMLto Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper
    <strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language
    of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href = 'http://learnenough.com/'>
    learnenough.com</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Founders</h2>
    <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl,
    Lee Donahoe and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical 
    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit 
    <strong>at least a billion people</strong> and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
    <p>
    Michael is the creator of the <a href = 'http://railstutorial.org/'>Ruby on Rails Tutorials</a> and
    principal author of the <a href = 'http://learnenough.com/'>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory
    sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href = 'http://kravmaga.com/'>Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
    plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supeervillain are slighlty exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Danahoe</h3>
    <p>
    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee
    in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing font-end development, or writing some of the interface-related
    Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
    <p>
    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but 
    rear assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a 
    tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical baility to take 
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    Gooling error messages and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
    learning technincal sophistication, probably more. To join our
